# YelpScrape v1

## Objective
This is a website to showcase proxying Yelp's GraphQL API. It includes a middle-ware implementation that handles client request to another third-party api and fetches a request back to the client.

## Why GraphQL?
GraphQL is very useful in that it allows the client to make the request for exactly the data they need. This also allows for the data to be aggregated in a single query for the client which reduces performance issues.

## Prequisites
- Beginner to Intermediate level understanding of ASP.NET Core mvc and C#.
- Visual Studio 2022
  - .NET 6 Framework
- Yelp Developer Account
  - API key
- BootsWatch
